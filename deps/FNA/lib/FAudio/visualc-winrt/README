Building FAudio for UWP
-----------------------
FAudio uses Visual Studio 2017 to build on Xbox One.

Dependencies
------------
Before building, download SDL2's source code from SDL's website:

http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

After extracting the zip file, be sure to rename the directory to remove the
version number (for example, 'SDL2-2.0.8' should be 'SDL2').

Compiling
---------
1. Build SDL2/VisualC-WinRT/UWP_VS2015/SDL-UWP.sln
2. Build FAudio.sln
3. Grab FAudio.dll and SDL2.dll, ship it!
