Building FAudio for Windows
---------------------------
FAudio uses Visual Studio 2010 to build on Windows.

TODO: REMOVE C RUNTIME DEPENDENCY!

Dependencies
------------
Before building, download SDL2's VC development libraries from SDL's website:

http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

After extracting the zip file, be sure to rename the directory to remove the
version number (for example, 'SDL2-2.0.8' should be 'SDL2').

Compiling
---------
1. Build FAudio.sln
2. Grab the output DLL along with SDL2.dll, ship it!
