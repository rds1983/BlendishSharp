Building Theorafile for Windows
-------------------------------
Theorafile uses Visual Studio 2010 to build on Windows.

Dependencies
------------
Before building, download libogg/libvorbis from the Xiph website:

https://xiph.org/downloads/

After extracting the zip files, be sure to rename the directories to remove the
version numbers (for example, 'libogg-1.3.2' should be 'libogg').

As of writing, libtheora 1.1.1 does not build with Visual Studio 2010. Instead,
download the upstream version via Git:

git clone git://github.com/xiph/theora.git libtheora

If building the sdl2test program, download SDL2's Visual Studio libraries:

http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

After extracting the zip file, be sure to rename the directory to remove the
version number (for example, 'SDL2-2.0.5' should be 'SDL2').

Compiling
---------
1. Build libogg/win32/VS2010/libogg_dynamic.sln
2. Build libvorbis/win32/VS2010/libvorbis_dynamic.sln
3. Build libtheora/win32/VS2010/libtheora_dynamic.sln
4. Build Theorafile/visualc/libtheorafile.sln
5. Grab the output DLL from each project, ship it!

Be sure your build configurations match for each library!
